# Anime Recommender using Hybrid Recommendation System

In this paper we have introduced a more efficient and flexible recommender system for anime recommendation. 


It allows a user to enter her unique id and name of the last watched anime and then recommend her an anime list based on the similarity matrix and user-item interaction matrix and using cosine similarity algorithm. 


To achieve the same, we took a hybrid approach that combines the functionalities of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. 


By doing this, we were able to successfully negate the faults in the individual algorithms and improve the performance of the system by whole. 


We also learned about the other technique that might be more precise and accurate while making recommendations. 


Hence, in the future, we plan to further improve our recommendation model by using more advanced techniques.
